# MaterialClockWidget
## Customizable clock widget with material theme and google fonts

This is only a widget without an attached app.
to use it simply look for it on your widget list (usually long pressing your launcher background)

~~READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is only there for fetching your current wallpaper for a nice preview in the configuration screen.~~
Idk how to get wallpapers with sdk33
